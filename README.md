## Features

### Core Mechanics
- Realistic ant movement with steering behaviors
- Obstacle avoidance system
- Pheromone-based communication
- Food gathering and transportation
- Nest-centered colony behavior

### Ant Types
1. **Worker Ants**:
   - Responsible for foraging food and gathering resources.
   - Exhibit pheromone-following behaviors to lead others to food sources.
   - Carry food back to the nest and deposit it for storage.

2. **Soldier Ants**:
   - Designed to protect the colony and worker ants.
   - Move towards nearby worker ants when they are in danger.
   - Maintain a distance from the nest while ensuring the safety of worker ants during food collection.

### Advanced Behaviors
1. **Food Collection System**:
   - Ants search for food sources
   - Food is gathered in concentrated spots
   - Automatic food replenishment
   - Visual feedback when ants carry food

2. **Pheromone System**:
   - Dynamic pheromone trails
   - Strength-based pheromone following
   - Pheromone decay over time
   - Different pheromone types (food and home trails)

3. **Anti-Clustering Mechanisms**:
   - Memory-based movement patterns
   - Stuck detection and resolution
   - Directional persistence
   - Random exploration factors

4.	**Teamwork Behavior:
	•	Soldier ants move to protect worker ants when they are nearby.
	•	Worker ants benefit from soldier protection, ensuring safer food collection.

### Pheromone Coefficients and Behavior Parameters

#### Pheromone Strengths
```python
PHEROMONE_STRENGTHS = {
    'carrying_food': 300,    # Strong trail when carrying food
    'returning_to_food': 200,  # Medium-strong trail when returning to known food
    'experienced': 100,      # Medium trail for experienced ants
    'exploring': 20         # Weak trail during exploration
}
```

#### Movement Parameters
```python
MOVEMENT_WEIGHTS = {
    'wander_force': 0.3,    # Base random movement
    'avoid_force': 2.0,     # Obstacle avoidance priority
    'pheromone_influence': {
        'carrying_food': 2.0,
        'returning': 1.5,
        'exploring': 0.4
    }
}
```

#### Anti-Clustering Parameters
```python
ANTI_CLUSTERING = {
    'memory_length': 30,    # Positions to remember
    'stuck_threshold': 40,  # Distance threshold for stuck detection
    'direction_persistence': {
        'min': 30,
        'max': 60
    }
}

## Implementation Details

### Ant States
1. **Exploring**:
   - Higher random movement
   - Lower pheromone influence
   - Active obstacle avoidance

2. **Food Found**:
   - Strong pheromone trail creation
   - Direct path to nest
   - Minimal random movement

3. **Returning to Food**:
   - Medium pheromone following
   - Remembered position influence
   - Moderate random movement

### Pheromone System Details
1. **Trail Creation**:
   - Stronger trails when carrying food
   - Medium strength for return trips
   - Weak trails during exploration
   - Automatic decay over time

2. **Following Behavior**:
   - Weighted influence based on pheromone strength
   - Distance-based effectiveness
   - Random variation to prevent clustering
   - Experience-based following efficiency

3. **Anti-Clustering Mechanics**:
   - Position memory system
   - Stuck detection algorithms
   - Direction persistence
   - Random force injection
